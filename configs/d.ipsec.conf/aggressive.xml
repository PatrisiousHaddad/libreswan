      Use IKEv1 Aggressive Mode instead of IKEv1 Main Mode. This
      option has no effect when IKEv2 is used.  Acceptable values are
      <option>no</option> (the default) or <option>yes</option>.
      When this option is enabled, IKEv1 Main Mode will no longer be
      allowed for this connection. The old name of this option was
      <option>aggrmode</option>.

    <para>
      Aggressive Mode is less secure, and more vulnerable to Denial Of
      Service attacks. It is also vulnerable to brute force attacks
      with software such as <option>ikecrack</option>.
      It should not be used, and it should especially not be used with
      XAUTH and group secrets (PSK).  If the remote system administrator
      insists on staying irresponsible, enable this option.

    <para>
      Aggressive Mode is further limited to only proposals with one DH
      group as there is no room to negotiate the DH group. Therefore
      it is mandatory for Aggressive Mode connections that both
      <option>ike=</option> and <option>esp=</option> options
      are specified with only one fully specified proposal using one DH group.

    <para>
      The KE payload is created in the first exchange packet when
      using aggressive mode. The KE payload depends on the DH group
      used.  This is why there cannot be multiple DH groups in IKEv1
      aggressive mode.  In IKEv2, which uses a similar method to IKEv1
      Aggressive Mode, there is an INVALID_KE response payload that
      can inform the initiator of the responder's desired DH group and
      so an IKEv2 connection can actually recover from picking the
      wrong DH group by restarting its negotiation.
