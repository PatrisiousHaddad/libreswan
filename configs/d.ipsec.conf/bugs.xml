    BUGS

  <para>
    Before reporting new bugs, please ensure you are using the latest
    version of Libreswan.
  </para>

  <para>
    When <emphasis>type</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>failureshunt</emphasis> is set to
    <emphasis>drop</emphasis> or <emphasis>reject,</emphasis>
    Libreswan blocks outbound packets using eroutes, but assumes
    inbound blocking is handled by the firewall. Libreswan offers
    firewall hooks via an &ldquo;updown&rdquo; script.  However, the
    default <command>ipsec _updown</command> provides no help in
    controlling a modern firewall.
  </para>

  <para>
    Including attributes of the keying channel (authentication
    methods, <emphasis>ikelifetime</emphasis>, etc.) as an
    attribute of a connection, rather than of a participant pair, is
    dubious and incurs limitations.
  </para>

  <para>
    The use of <emphasis>%any</emphasis> with the <emphasis>protoport=</emphasis>
    option is ambiguous. Should the SA permits any port through or should
    the SA negotiate any single port through?  The first is a basic conn with
    a wildcard. The second is a template. The second is the current behaviour,
    and it's wrong for quite a number of uses involving TCP. The keyword
    <emphasis>%one</emphasis> may be introduced in the
    future to separate these two cases.
  </para>

  <para>
    It would be good to have a line-continuation syntax, especially
    for the very long lines involved in RSA signature keys.
  </para>

  <para>
    The ability to specify different identities, <emphasis>authby</emphasis>,
    and public keys for different automatic-keyed connections between
    the same participants is misleading; this doesn't work dependably
    because the identity of the participants is not known early enough.
    This is especially awkward for the &ldquo;Road Warrior&rdquo; case,
    where the remote IP address is specified as <literal>0.0.0.0</literal>,
    and that is considered to be the &ldquo;participant&rdquo; for such
    connections.
  </para>

  <para>
    If conns are to be added before DNS is available, <emphasis>left=</emphasis>
    <emphasis>FQDN</emphasis>, <emphasis>leftnextop=</emphasis><emphasis>FQDN</emphasis>,
    and <emphasis>leftrsasigkey=%dnsonload</emphasis> will fail.
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_pluto</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    does not actually use the public key for our side of a conn but it
    isn't generally known at a add-time which side is ours (Road
    Warrior and Opportunistic conns are currently exceptions).
  </para>
