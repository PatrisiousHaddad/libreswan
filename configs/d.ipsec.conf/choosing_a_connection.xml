    CHOOSING A CONNECTION [THIS SECTION IS EXTREMELY OUT OF DATE
  </title>
  <para>
    When choosing a connection to apply to an outbound packet caught
    with a <emphasis>%trap,</emphasis> the system prefers
    the one with the most specific eroute that includes the packet's
    source and destination IP addresses.  Source subnets are examined
    before destination subnets.  For initiating, only routed
    connections are considered. For responding, unrouted but added
    connections are considered.
  </para>
  <para>
    When choosing a connection to use to respond to a negotiation
    that doesn't match an ordinary conn, an opportunistic connection may
    be instantiated. Eventually, its instance will be /32 -&gt; /32, but
    for earlier stages of the negotiation, there will not be enough
    information about the client subnets to complete the
    instantiation.
