    <para>
      the address family of the clients (subnets); currently the
      accepted values are <option>ipv4</option> and
      <option>ipv6</option>. The default is to detect
      this based on the network IP addresses specified or the network
      IP addresses resolved, so this option is not needed, unless you
      specify names that resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6.
