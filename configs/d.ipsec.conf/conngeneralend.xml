  If one or both security gateways are doing forwarding firewalling
  (possibly including masquerading), and this is specified using the
  firewall parameters, tunnels established with IPsec are exempted
  from it so that packets can flow unchanged through the tunnels.
  (This means that all subnets connected in this manner must have
  distinct, non-overlapping subnet address blocks.)  This is done by
  the default <option>updown</option> script (see
  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_pluto</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>).

  The implementation of this makes certain assumptions about firewall
  setup, and the availability of the <option>Linux
  Advanced Routing</option> tools.  In situations calling for more
  control, it may be preferable for the user to supply his own
  <option>updown</option> script, which makes the
  appropriate adjustments for his system.
