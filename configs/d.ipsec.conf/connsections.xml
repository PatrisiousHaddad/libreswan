    DESCRIPTION
  </title>
  <para>
    The <emphasis>ipsec.conf</emphasis> file specifies most
    configuration and control information for the Libreswan IPsec
    subsystem.  (The major exception is secrets for authentication;
    see
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec.secrets</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>.)
    Its contents are not security-sensitive. Configurations can be
    added using this configuration file or by using ipsec whack
    directly. This means that technically, the ipsec.conf file is
    optional, but a few warnings might show up when this file is
    missing.
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>ipsec.conf</emphasis> is a text file,
    consisting of one or more <emphasis>sections</emphasis>.
    White space followed by <emphasis>#</emphasis> followed
    by anything to the end of the line is a comment and is ignored, as
    are empty lines that are not within a section.
  </para>

  <para>
    A line that contains <emphasis>include</emphasis> and a
    file name, separated by white space, is replaced by the contents
    of that file, preceded and followed by empty lines.  If the file
    name is not a full pathname, it is considered to be relative to
    the directory that contains the including file.  Such inclusions
    can be nested.  Only a single filename may be supplied, and it may
    not contain white space, but it may include shell wildcards (see
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>sh</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>);
    for example:
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>include </emphasis> <emphasis>/etc/ipsec.d/*.conf</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
    The intention of the include facility is mostly to permit keeping
    information on connections, or sets of connections, separate from
    the main configuration file.  This permits such connection
    descriptions to be changed, copied to the other security gateways
    involved, etc., without having to constantly extract them from the
    configuration file and then insert them back into it.  Note also
    the <emphasis>also</emphasis> and <emphasis>alsoflip</emphasis>
    parameters (described below) which permit splitting a single
    logical section (e.g. a connection description) into several
    distinct sections.
  </para>

  <para>
    The first significant line of the file may specify a version of
    this specification for backwards compatibility with freeswan and
    openswan. It is ignored and unused. For compatibility with
    openswan, specify:
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>version 2</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
    A section begins with a line of the form:
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>type</emphasis> <emphasis>name</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
    where <emphasis>type</emphasis> indicates what type of
    section follows, and <emphasis>name</emphasis> is an
    arbitrary name that distinguishes the section from others of the
    same type.  (Names must start with a letter and may contain only
    letters, digits, periods, underscores, and hyphens.)  All
    subsequent non-empty lines that begin with white space are part of
    the section; comments within a section must begin with white space
    too.  There may be only one section of a given type with a given
    name.
  </para>

  <para>
    Lines within the section are generally of the form
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>parameter</emphasis><emphasis>=</emphasis><emphasis>value</emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
    (note the mandatory preceding white space).  There can be white
    space on either side of the <emphasis>=</emphasis>.
    Parameter names follow the same syntax as section names, and are
    specific to a section type.  Unless otherwise explicitly
    specified, no parameter name may appear more than once in a
    section.
  </para>

  <para>
    An empty <emphasis>value</emphasis> stands for the
    system default value (if any) of the parameter, i.e. it is roughly
    equivalent to omitting the parameter line entirely.
    A <emphasis>value</emphasis> may contain white space only if the
    entire <emphasis>value</emphasis> is enclosed in double
    quotes (<emphasis>"</emphasis>); a <emphasis>value</emphasis>
    cannot itself contain a double quote, nor may it be continued
    across more than one line.
  </para>

  <para>
    Numeric values are specified to be either an &ldquo;integer&rdquo;
    (a sequence of digits) or a &ldquo;decimal number&rdquo; (sequence
    of digits optionally followed by `.' and another sequence of
    digits).
  </para>

  <para>
    There is currently one parameter that is available in any type of
    section:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term><emphasis>also</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  the value is a section name; the parameters of that section
	  are appended to this section, as if they had been written as
	  part of it.  The specified section must exist, must follow
	  the current one, and must have the same section type.
	  (Nesting is permitted, and there may be more than one
	  <emphasis>also</emphasis> in a single section,
	  although it is forbidden to append the same section more
	  than once.)  This allows, for example, keeping the
	  encryption keys for a connection in a separate file from the
	  rest of the description, by using both an <emphasis>also</emphasis>
	  parameter and an <emphasis>include</emphasis> line.
	  (Caution, see BUGS below for some restrictions.)
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
	<emphasis>alsoflip</emphasis>
      </term>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  can be used in a <emphasis>conn</emphasis>
	  section.  It acts like an <emphasis>also</emphasis> that flips
	  the referenced section's entries left-for-right.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>
    Parameter names beginning with <emphasis>x-</emphasis>
    (or <emphasis>X-</emphasis>, or <emphasis>x_</emphasis>,
    or <emphasis>X_</emphasis>) are reserved for user extensions
    and will never be assigned meanings by IPsec.
    Parameters with such names must still observe the syntax rules
    (limits on characters used in the name; no white space in
    a non-quoted value; no newlines or double quotes within the value).
    All other as-yet-unused parameter names are reserved for future IPsec
    improvements.
  </para>

  <para>
    A section with name <emphasis>%default</emphasis>
    specifies defaults for sections of the same type.  For each
    parameter in it, any section of that type that does not have a
    parameter of the same name gets a copy of the one from the
    <emphasis>%default</emphasis> section.  There may be
    multiple <emphasis>%default</emphasis> sections of a
    given type, but only one default may be supplied for any specific
    parameter name.  <emphasis>%default</emphasis> sections
    may not contain <emphasis>also</emphasis> or <emphasis>alsoflip</emphasis>
    parameters.
  </para>

  <para>
    Currently there are two types of section: a <emphasis>config</emphasis>
    section specifies general configuration information for IPsec,
    while a <emphasis>conn</emphasis> section specifies an IPsec connection.
  </para>
