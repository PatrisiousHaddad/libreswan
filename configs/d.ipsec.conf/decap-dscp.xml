      Enable decapsulating the Differentiated Services Code Point
      (DSCP, formerly known as Terms Of Service (TOS)) bits. If these
      bits are set on the inner (encrypted) IP packets, these bits are
      set on the decrypted IP packets.  Acceptable values are
      <option>no</option> (the default) or <option>yes</option>.
      Currently this feature is only implemented for the Linux XFRM stack.
