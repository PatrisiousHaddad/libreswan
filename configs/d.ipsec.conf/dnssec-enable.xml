      Whether pluto should perform dnssec validation using libunbound,
      provided libreswan was compiled with USE_DNSSEC. A value of
      <option>yes</option> (the default) means pluto
      should perform DNSSEC validation. Note that pluto reads the file
      <option>/etc/resolv.conf</option> to determine
      which nameservers to use.
