      Set the length of time (in time units, defaults to seconds) that
      pluto will idle without hearing back from the peer. After this
      period has elapsed with no response and no traffic, pluto will
      declare the peer dead, and remove the SA (default
      <literal>0</literal> meaning disabled). Set value bigger than
      dpddelay to enable. If dpdtimeout is set, dpddelay also needs to
      be set.

      This option is only valid for IKEv1. For IKEv2, this value is
      always the same as the retransmit-timeout, as IKEv2 is blocked
      from sending further IKE messages if an answer is not
      received.
