      Normally, IKE negotiation and ESP encapsulation happens over
      UDP. This option enables support for IKE and ESP over TCP as per
      RFC 8229. Acceptable values are <option>no</option>(the default),
      <option>yes</option> meaning only TCP will be used, or
      <option>fallback</option> meaning that TCP will be
      attempted only after negotiation over UDP failed. Since
      performance over TCP is much less, and TCP sessions are
      vulnerable to simply RST resets and MITM attacks causing the TCP
      connection to close, this option should really only be used in
      fallback mode.  If used in fallback mode, it is recommend to
      reduce the <option>retransmit-timeout</option>
      from the default 60s to a much shorter value such as 10s, so
      that one does not have to wait a minute for the TCP fallback to
      be attempted. To receive incoming TCP connections, the
      <option>config setup</option> option <option>listen-tcp</option>
      needs to be enabled.
