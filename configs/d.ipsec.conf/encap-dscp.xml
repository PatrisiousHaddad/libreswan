      Enable encapsulating the Differentiated Services Code Point
      (DSCP, formerly known as Terms Of Service (TOS)) bits. The extra
      xfrm flag "dont-encap-dscp" prevents these bits from being
      copied from the unencrypted IP packets to the encrypted IP
      packets.  Acceptable values are <option>yes</option>
      (the default) or <option>no</option>.
      Currently this feature is only implemented for the Linux XFRM stack.
