      Whether or not to enable Extended Sequence Number (ESN) for the
      IPsec SA. This option is only implemented for IKEv2. ESN is
      typically used for very high-speed links (10Gbps or faster)
      where the standard 32 bit sequence number is exhausted too
      quickly, causing IPsec SA's rekeys to happen too often. Accepted
      values are <option>either</option> (the default),
      <option>yes</option> and <option>no</option>.
      If <option>either</option> is specified as an initiator,
      the responder will make the choice. As a responder,
      if <option>either</option> is received,
      <option>yes</option> is picked.
    </para>
    <para>
      If replay-window is set to 0, ESN is disabled as some (most?)
      IPsec stacks won't support ESN in such a configuration.
