      whether to send a STRONGSWAN Vendor ID payload to the peer.
      Acceptable values are: <option>no</option> (the
      default) and <option>yes</option>.  This used to
      be required because strongswan rejects certain proposals with
      private use numbers such as esp=twofish or esp=serpent unless it
      receives a strongswan vendorid by the peer. This option sends
      such an (unversioned) vendor id. Note that libreswan and
      strongswan no longer support twofish or serpent, so enabling
      this option likely will no longer do anything.
