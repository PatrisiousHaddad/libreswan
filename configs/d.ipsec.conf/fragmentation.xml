      Whether or not to allow IKE fragmentation.  Valid values are
      <emphasis>yes</emphasis> (the default) and <emphasis>no</emphasis>.
      In addition IKEv1 allows <emphasis>force</emphasis>.

      IKEv2 fragmentation support is implemented using RFC 7383.

    <para>
      IKEv1 fragmentation capabilities are negotiated via a well-known
      private <emphasis>vendor id</emphasis>.  If pluto does
      not receive the fragmentation payload, no IKE fragments will be
      sent, regardless of the <emphasis>fragmentation=</emphasis> setting.
      When set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, IKE fragmentation will be
      attempted on the first re-transmit of an IKE packet of a size
      larger then 576 bytes for IPv4 and 1280 bytes for IPv6.  If
      fragmentation is set to force, IKE fragmentation is used on
      initial transmits of such sized packets as well.  When we have
      received IKE fragments for a connection, pluto behaves as if in
      force mode.
