    <para>
      the address family of the hosts; currently the accepted values
      are <option>ipv4</option> and <option>ipv6</option>.
      The default is to detect this based on the IP addresses specified
      or the IP addresses resolved, so this option is not needed, unless
      you specify hostnames that resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6.

    <para>
      This option used to be named connaddrfamily but its use was broken
      so it was obsoleted in favour or using the new hostaddrfamily and
      clientaddrfamily.
