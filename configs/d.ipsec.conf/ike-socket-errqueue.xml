      Whether to enable or disable receiving socket errors via
      IP_RECVERR. The default is enabled. This will cause the socket
      to receive, process and log socket errors, such as ICMP
      unreachable messages or Connection Refused messages. Disabling
      this only makes sense on very busy servers, and even then it
      might not make much of a difference. This option can also be
      toggled on a running system using <option>ipsec
      whack --ike-socket-errqueue-toggle</option>.
