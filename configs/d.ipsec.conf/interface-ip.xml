      The IP address and netmask to configure on a virtual device (eg
      ipsecXXX). This is often used when building Routing based IPsec
      tunnels using transport mode and GRE, but can also be useful in
      other scenarios. Currently requires
      <option>ipsec-interface=</option>. See also
      <option>leftvti=</option> for configuring IP addresses when
      using deprecated VTI.
