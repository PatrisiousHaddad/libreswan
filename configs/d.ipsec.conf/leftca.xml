      specifies the authorized Certificate Authority (CA) that signed
      the certificate of the peer. If undefined, it defaults to the CA
      that signed the certificate specified in <emphasis>leftcert</emphasis>.
      The special <emphasis>rightca=%same</emphasis> is implied when not
      specifying a <emphasis>rightca</emphasis> and means
      that only peers with certificates signed by the same CA as the
      leftca will be allowed. This option is only useful in complex
      multi CA certificate situations. When using a single CA, it can
      be safely omitted for both left and right.
