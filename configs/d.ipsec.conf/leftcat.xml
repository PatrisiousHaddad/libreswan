      Whether to perform Client Address Translation ("CAT") when using
      Opportunistic IPsec behind NAT.  Accepted values are <emphasis>no</emphasis>
      (the default) and <emphasis>yes</emphasis>. This option should
      only be enabled on the special Opportunistic IPsec connections,
      usually called "private" and "private-or-clear". When set, this
      option causes the given addresspool IP from the remote peer to be
      NATed with nftables or iptables. It will also install an additional
      IPsec SA policy to cover the pre-NAT IP. See the Opportunistic IPsec
      information on the libreswan website for more information and examples.
