<para>This option configures when Libreswan will send X.509 certificates to the remote
host. Acceptable values are
<emphasis>yes|always</emphasis>
(signifying that we should always send a certificate),
<emphasis>sendifasked</emphasis>
(signifying that we should send a certificate if the remote end asks for it), and
<emphasis>no|never</emphasis>
(signifying that we will never send a X.509 certificate).
The default for this option is
<emphasis>sendifasked</emphasis>
which may break compatibility with other vendor's IPsec implementations, such as
Cisco and SafeNet. If you find that you are getting errors about no ID/Key found,
you likely need to set this to
<emphasis>always</emphasis>.
This per-conn option replaces the obsolete global <emphasis>nocrsend</emphasis>
option.
