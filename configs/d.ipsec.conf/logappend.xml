      If pluto is instructed to log to a file using
      <option>logfile=</option>, this option determines whether the
      log file should be appended to or overwritten. Valid options are
      <option>yes</option> (the default) to append and
      <option>no</option> to overwrite. Since on modern systems, pluto
      is restarted by other daemons, such as systemd, this option
      should be left at its default yes value to preserve the log
      entries of previous runs of pluto. The option is mainly of use
      for running the test suite, which needs to create new log files
      from scratch.
