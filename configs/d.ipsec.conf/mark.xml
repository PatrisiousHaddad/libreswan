      If set, the MARK to set for the IPsec SA of this connection. The
      format of a CONNMARK is <option>mark/mask</option>. If the mask
      is left out, a default mask of 0xffffffff is used. A mark value
      of -1 means to assign a new global unique mark number for each
      instance of the connection. Global marks start at 1001.  This
      option is only available on linux XFRM kernels. It can be used
      with iptables to create custom iptables rules using CONNMARK. It
      can also be used with Virtual Tunnel Interfaces ("VTI") to
      direct marked traffic to specific vtiXX devices.
