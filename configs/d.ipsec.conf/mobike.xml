      Whether to allow MOBIKE (RFC 4555) to enable a connection to
      migrate its endpoint without needing to restart the connection
      from scratch. This is used on mobile devices that switch between
      wired, wireless or mobile data connections. Current values are
      <option>no</option> (the default) or <option>yes</option>, Only
      connection acting as modecfgclient will allow the initiator to
      migrate using mobike. Only connections acting as modecfgserver
      will allow clients to migrate.
