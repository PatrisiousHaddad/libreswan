its endpoint without needing to restart the connection from scratch. This
is used on mobile devices that switch between wired, wireless or mobile
data connections. Current values are <emphasis>no</emphasis> (the default)
or <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, Only connection acting as modecfgclient
will allow the initiator to migrate using mobike. Only connections acting as
modecfgserver will allow clients to migrate.
