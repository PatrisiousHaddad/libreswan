<para>If set, the NFLOG group number to log <option>all</option> pre-crypt and post-decrypt traffic to.
The default value of <option>0</option> means no logging at all.
This option is only available on linux kernel 2.6.14 and later. It allows
common network utilities such as tcpdump, wireshark and dumpcap, to use
nflog:XXX pseudo interfaces where XXX is the nflog group number. During
startup and shutdown of the IPsec service, iptables commands will be used to
add or remove the global NFLOG table rules. The rules are setup with the
nflog-prefix <option>all-ipsec</option>. See also the per-connection
<option>nflog</option> option.
