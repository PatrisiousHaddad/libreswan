<para>Set the method of Network Interface Controller (NIC)
hardware offload for ESP/AH packet processing.  Acceptable values
are <emphasis>auto</emphasis> (the default),
<emphasis>crypto</emphasis>, <emphasis>packet</emphasis>
or <emphasis>no</emphasis>. The value <emphasis>yes</emphasis>
is a backwards compatible value for <emphasis>crypto</emphasis>.
This option is separate from any CPU hardware offload available.
The crypto value offloads the crypto operations to the NIC card and is
available on Linux 4.13+ using the XFRM IPsec stack, when the kernel is
compiled with the options CONFIG_XFRM_OFFLOAD, CONFIG_INET_ESP_OFFLOAD
and CONFIG_INET6_ESP_OFFLOAD. The packet value offloads the entire cleartext
packet to the NIC card to be encrypted and is available on Linux 6.3+ using
the XFRM IPsec stack. The auto option will attempt to auto-detect
the presence of kernel and hardware support, and if found, attempt to install
a packet offload IPsec SA. Failing this, it will fallback to attempt a crypto
offload IPsec SA, and failing that it will fall back to not using any nic-offload.
This fallback would then use the regular CPUs (and their hardware offload, such as
AES-NI). One vendor supporting this offload method is Nvidia/Mellanox.</para>
