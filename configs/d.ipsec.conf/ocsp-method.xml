      The HTTP methods used for fetching OCSP data. Valid options are
      <option>get</option> (the default) and
      <option>post</option>. Note that this behaviour depends on the
      NSS crypto library that is actually performing the
      fetching. When set to the get method, post is attempted only as
      fallback in case of failure. When set to post, only the post
      method is ever used.
