    OPPORTUNISTIC CONNS
  </title>
  <para>
    For Opportunistic connections, the system requires creating
    special named conns that are used to implement the default policy
    groups. Currently, these names cannot be changed.

  <para>
    may contain policy group configuration information to supplement
    <option>ipsec.conf</option>.  Their contents are not
    security-sensitive.
  </para>

<para>
  These files are text files.  Each consists of a list of CIDR blocks,
  one per line.  White space followed by # followed by anything to the
  end of the line is a comment and is ignored, as are empty lines.
</para>

<para>
  A connection in <filename>ipsec.conf</filename> that has
  <option>right=%group</option> or <option>right=%opportunisticgroup</option>
  is a policy group connection. When a policy group file of
  the same name is loaded at system start, the connection is
  instantiated such that each CIDR block serves as an instance's
  <option>right</option> value. The system treats the resulting
  instances as normal connections.
</para>

<para>
  For example, given a suitable connection definition <option>private</option>,
  and the file <filename>@@IPSEC_CONFDDIR@@/policies/private</filename> with an entry
  192.0.2.3, the system creates a connection instance <option>private#192.0.2.3.</option>
  This connection inherits all details from <option>private</option>,
  except that its right client is 192.0.2.3.

    DEFAULT POLICY GROUPS

  <para>
    The standard Libreswan install includes several policy groups
    which provide a way of classifying possible peers into IPsec
    security classes: <option>private</option> (talk
    encrypted only), <option>private-or-clear</option>
    (prefer encryption), <option>clear-or-private</option>
    (respond to requests for encryption), <option>clear</option>
    and <option>block</option>.
