    OPPORTUNISTIC CONNS
  </title>
  <para>
    For Opportunistic connections, the system requires creating
    special named conns that are used to implement the default policy
    groups. Currently, these names cannot be changed.

  <para>
    may contain policy group configuration information to supplement
    <emphasis remap='I'>ipsec.conf</emphasis>.  Their contents are not
    security-sensitive.
  </para>

<para>
  These files are text files.  Each consists of a list of CIDR blocks,
  one per line.  White space followed by # followed by anything to the
  end of the line is a comment and is ignored, as are empty lines.
</para>

<para>
  A connection in <filename>ipsec.conf</filename> that has <emphasis
  remap='B'>right=%group</emphasis> or <emphasis
  remap='B'>right=%opportunisticgroup</emphasis> is a policy group
  connection.  When a policy group file of the same name is loaded at
  system start, the connection is instantiated such that each CIDR
  block serves as an instance's <emphasis remap='B'>right</emphasis>
  value. The system treats the resulting instances as normal
  connections.
</para>

<para>
  For example, given a suitable connection definition <emphasis
  remap='B'>private</emphasis>, and the file
  <filename>/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private</filename> with an entry
  192.0.2.3, the system creates a connection instance <emphasis
  remap='B'>private#192.0.2.3.</emphasis> This connection inherits all
  details from <emphasis remap='B'>private</emphasis>, except that its
  right client is 192.0.2.3.

    DEFAULT POLICY GROUPS

  <para>
    The standard Libreswan install includes several policy groups
    which provide a way of classifying possible peers into IPsec
    security classes: <emphasis remap='B'>private</emphasis> (talk
    encrypted only), <emphasis remap='B'>private-or-clear</emphasis>
    (prefer encryption), <emphasis
    remap='B'>clear-or-private</emphasis> (respond to requests for
    encryption), <emphasis remap='B'>clear</emphasis> and <emphasis
    remap='B'>block</emphasis>.
