    OPPORTUNISTIC CONNS
  </title>
  <para>
    For Opportunistic connections, the system requires creating
    special named conns that are used to implement the default policy
    groups. Currently, these names cannot be changed.

  <para>
    may contain policy group configuration information to supplement
    <emphasis>ipsec.conf</emphasis>.  Their contents are not
    security-sensitive.
  </para>

<para>
  These files are text files.  Each consists of a list of CIDR blocks,
  one per line.  White space followed by # followed by anything to the
  end of the line is a comment and is ignored, as are empty lines.
</para>

<para>
  A connection in <filename>ipsec.conf</filename> that has
  <emphasis>right=%group</emphasis> or <emphasis>right=%opportunisticgroup</emphasis>
  is a policy group connection. When a policy group file of
  the same name is loaded at system start, the connection is
  instantiated such that each CIDR block serves as an instance's
  <emphasis>right</emphasis> value. The system treats the resulting
  instances as normal connections.
</para>

<para>
  For example, given a suitable connection definition <emphasis>private</emphasis>,
  and the file <filename>@@IPSEC__CONFDDIR@@/policies/private</filename> with an entry
  192.0.2.3, the system creates a connection instance <emphasis>private#192.0.2.3.</emphasis>
  This connection inherits all details from <emphasis>private</emphasis>,
  except that its right client is 192.0.2.3.

    DEFAULT POLICY GROUPS

  <para>
    The standard Libreswan install includes several policy groups
    which provide a way of classifying possible peers into IPsec
    security classes: <emphasis>private</emphasis> (talk
    encrypted only), <emphasis>private-or-clear</emphasis>
    (prefer encryption), <emphasis>clear-or-private</emphasis>
    (respond to requests for encryption), <emphasis>clear</emphasis>
    and <emphasis>block</emphasis>.
