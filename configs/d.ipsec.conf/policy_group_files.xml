  <para>
    may contain policy group configuration information to supplement
    <option>ipsec.conf</option>.  Their contents are not
    security-sensitive.
  </para>
  <para>
    These files are text files.  Each consists of a list of CIDR
    blocks, one per line.  White space followed by # followed by
    anything to the end of the line is a comment and is ignored, as
    are empty lines.
  </para>
  <para>
    A connection in <filename>ipsec.conf</filename> that has
    <option>right=%group</option> or
    <option>right=%opportunisticgroup</option> is a policy group
    connection. When a policy group file of the same name is loaded at
    system start, the connection is instantiated such that each CIDR
    block serves as an instance's <option>right</option> value. The
    system treats the resulting instances as normal connections.
  </para>
  <para>
    For example, given a suitable connection definition
    <option>private</option>, and the file
    <filename>@@IPSEC_CONFDDIR@@/policies/private</filename> with an
    entry 192.0.2.3, the system creates a connection instance
    <option>private#192.0.2.3.</option> This connection inherits all
    details from <option>private</option>, except that its right
    client is 192.0.2.3.
