<para>EXPERIMENTAL: Post-quantum preshared keys (PPKs) to be used. Currently the accepted values are
<option>propose</option> or <option>yes</option>
(the default), signifying we propose to use PPK for this connection;
<option>insist</option>, signifying we allow communication
only if PPK is used for key derivation;
<option>never</option> or <option>no</option>,
signifying that PPK should not be used for key derivation.
PPKs can be used in connections that allow only IKEv2. In libreswan that would
mean that ikev2 option must have value <option>insist</option>.
 This feature is based on RFC 8784.
