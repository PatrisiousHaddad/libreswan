<para>whether a connection should be renegotiated when it is about to expire;
acceptable values are
<option>yes</option>
(the default)
and
<option>no</option>.
The two ends need not agree,
but while a value of
<option>no</option>
prevents Pluto from requesting renegotiation,
it does not prevent responding to renegotiation requested from the other end,
so
<option>no</option>
will be largely ineffective unless both ends agree on it.</para>
