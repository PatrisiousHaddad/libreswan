      Set the remote peer type. This can enable additional processing
      during the IKEv1 negotiation. Acceptable values are
      <option>cisco</option> or <option>ietf</option> (the
      default). When set to cisco, support for Cisco IPsec gateway
      redirection and Cisco obtained DNS and domainname are
      enabled. This includes automatically updating (and restoring)
      /etc/resolv.conf. These options require that XAUTH is also
      enabled on this connection.
