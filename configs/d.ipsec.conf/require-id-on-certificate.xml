<para>When using certificates, check whether the IKE peer ID is present as a
subjectAltName (SAN) on the peer certificate. Accepted values are
<option>yes</option> (the default) or <option>no</option>.
This check should only be disabled when intentionally using certificates that do not have
their peer ID specified as a SAN on the certificate. These certificates violate RFC 4945
Section 3.1 and are normally rejected to prevent a compromised host from assuming the
IKE identity of another host. The SAN limits the IDs that the peer is able to assume.
