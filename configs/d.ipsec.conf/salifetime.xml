      how long a particular instance of a connection (a set of
      encryption/authentication keys for user packets) should last,
      from successful negotiation to expiry; acceptable values are an
      integer optionally followed by <option>s</option> (a time in
      seconds) or a decimal number followed by <option>m</option>,
      <option>h</option>, or <option>d</option> (a time in minutes,
      hours, or days respectively) (default <option>8h</option>,
      maximum <option>24h</option>).  Normally, the connection is
      renegotiated (via the keying channel) before it expires.  The
      two ends need not exactly agree on <option>salifetime</option>,
      although if they do not, there will be some clutter of
      superseded connections on the end which thinks the lifetime is
      longer.

      The keywords "keylife" and "lifetime" are obsoleted aliases for
      "salifetime."  Change your configs to use "salifetime" instead.
