  <listitem>
<para>how long a particular instance of a connection
(a set of encryption/authentication keys for user packets) should last,
from successful negotiation to expiry;
acceptable values are an integer optionally followed by
<emphasis>s</emphasis>
(a time in seconds)
or a decimal number followed by
<emphasis>m</emphasis>,
<emphasis>h</emphasis>,
or
<emphasis>d</emphasis>
(a time
in minutes, hours, or days respectively)
(default
<emphasis>8h</emphasis>,
maximum
<emphasis>24h</emphasis>).
Normally, the connection is renegotiated (via the keying channel)
before it expires.
The two ends need not exactly agree on
<emphasis>salifetime</emphasis>,
although if they do not,
there will be some clutter of superseded connections on the end
which thinks the lifetime is longer. </para>
<para>
The keywords "keylife" and "lifetime" are obsoleted aliases for "salifetime."
Change your configs to use "salifetime" instead.
