      Enable Traffic Flow Confidentiality ("TFC") (RFC-4303) for outgoing ESP
      packets in Tunnel Mode.  When enabled, ESP packets are padded to the
      specified size (up to the PMTU size) to prevent leaking information based
      on ESP packet size. This option is ignored for AH and for ESP in Transport
      Mode as those always leak traffic characteristics and applying TFC will
      not do anything. Acceptable values are positive numbers. The value 0 means
      TFC padding is not performed. Currently this feature is only implemented
      for the Linux XFRM stack. In IKEv2, when the notify payload
      ESP_TFC_PADDING_NOT_SUPPORTED is received, TFC padding is disabled. The
      default is not to do any TFC padding, but this might change in the near
      future.
