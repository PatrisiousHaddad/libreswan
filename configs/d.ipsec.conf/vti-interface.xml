      This option is used to create "Routing based VPNs"
      (as opposed to "Policy based VPNs"). It will create a new interface
      that can be used to route traffic in for encryption/decryption. The Virtual
      Tunnel Interface ("VTI") interface name is used to for all IPsec SA's created by
      this connection. This requires that the connection also enables either
      the <option>mark=</option> or <option>mark-in= /
      mark-out-</option> option(s). All traffic marked with the proper MARKs
      will be automatically encrypted if there is an IPsec SA policy covering the
      source/destination traffic. Tools such as tcpdump and iptables can be
      used on all cleartext pre-encrypt and post-decrypt traffic on the device.
      See the libreswan wiki for example configurations that use VTI.

      VTI interfaces are currently only supported on Linux with
      XFRM. The _updown script handles certain Linux specific
      interfaces settings required for proper functioning
      (disable_policy, rp_filter, forwarding, etc). Interface names
      are limited to 16 characters and may not allow all characters to
      be used. If marking and <option>vti-routing=yes</option> is
      used, no manual iptables should be required. However,
      administrators can use the iptables mangle table to mark traffic
      manually if desired.
