      Whether or not to add network rules or routes for IPsec
      SA's to the respective VTI devices. Valid values are
      <option>yes</option> (the default) or <option>no</option>.
      When using "routing based VPNs" with a subnets policy of 0.0.0.0/0,
      this setting needs to set to <option>no</option> to prevent
      imploding the tunnel, and the administrator is expected to manually
      add ip rules and ip routes to configure what traffic must be encrypted.
      When set to <option>yes</option>, the _updown script will
      automatically route the leftsubnet/rightsubnet traffic into the
      VTI device specified with <option>vti-interface</option>
