      Whether or not the VTI device is shared amongst connections.
      Valid values are <option>no</option> (the default) or
      <option>yes</option>. When set to no, the VTI device is
      automatically deleted if the connection is a single
      non-instantiated connection. If a connection instantiates (eg
      right=%any) then this option has no effect, as the VTI device is
      not removed as it is shared with multiple roadwarriors.
