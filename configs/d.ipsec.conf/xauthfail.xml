      When XAUTH support is available, set the failure method desired
      when authentication has failed.  The currently supported values
      are <option>hard</option> (the default) and
      <option>soft</option>. A soft failure means the IPsec SA is
      allowed to be established, as if authentication had passed
      successfully, but the XAUTH_FAILED environment variable will be
      set to 1 for the updown script, which can then be used to
      redirect the user into a walled garden, for example a payment
      portal.
