test nic-offload

It isn't expected to orient, which is good as at that point it would
notice that all interfaces don't support hardware offload.

Paul: Note I don't think that is true. We do not know if the interface
supports hardware offload, even after setup_esp_nic_offload(). Only at
add_sa() time.
