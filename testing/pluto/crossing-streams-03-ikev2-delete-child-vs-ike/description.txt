WEST sending IKE SA delete CROSSES EAST sending Child SA delete

WEST and EAST establish IKE and Child SA

- WEST sends an IKE SA delete which is blocked
- EAST sends a Child SA delete which is blocked

At this point both ends think they are the one deleting.

- WEST processes EAST's Child SA delete deleting the Child SA

- Because the IKE SA is being deleted it is not viable and can't be
  used to revive the connection!

Since things are still +UP, WEST revives using a new IKE and Child SA.
