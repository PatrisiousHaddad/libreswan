WEST sending Child SA delete CROSSES EAST sending Child SA delete

EAST and WEST establish IKE and Child SAs

- WEST sends a Child SA delete which is blocked
- EAST sends a Child SA delete which is blocked

At this point both ends think they are the one deleting.

- WEST processes EAST's Child SA delete, deleting the Child SA sending
  back a response causing EAST to also delete the SA

- EAST processes WEST's Child SA delete but there is none so it
  returns a NADA reply

  because WEST recorded the SA being deleted it includes this in the
  log message (even though it doesn't exist)

Since things are still +UP, WEST will revive the connection using the
still established IKE SA.
