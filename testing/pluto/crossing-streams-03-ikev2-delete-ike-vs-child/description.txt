WEST sending Child SA delete CROSSES EAST sending IKE SA delete

EAST and WEST establish IKE and Child SAs

- WEST sends Child SA delete but is blocked
- EAST sends IKE SA delete but is blocked

At this point both ends think they are the one deleting.

- WEST processes EAST's IKE SA delete deleting everything

Since things are still +UP, WEST revives using a new IKE and Child SA.
