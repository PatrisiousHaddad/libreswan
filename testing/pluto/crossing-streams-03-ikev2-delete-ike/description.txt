WEST sending IKE SA delete CROSSES EAST sending IKE SA delete

EAST and WEST establish IKE SA + Child SA

- WEST sends IKE SA delete but it is blocked
- EAST sends IKE SA delete but it is blocked

At this point both ends think they are the one deleting.

- WEST processes EAST's IKE SA delete trumping its own delete request

Since things are still +UP, WEST should revive a new IKE and Child SA.
