The second IKEv2 child is getting ready to initiate, the IKE SA initiates a delete.

Something like the following:

- cuckoo finds cuckold's IKE SA is viable parent
- cuckoo starts crypto (made to sleep 5)
- cuckold's IKE SA told to go down
- cuckold's IKE SA no longer viable parent
- cuckold sends delete IKE SA which is stalled
- cuckoo finishes crypto
- cuckoo finds cuckold's IKE SA no longer viable and reschedules
- cuckoo brings up its own IKE SA + Child SA
