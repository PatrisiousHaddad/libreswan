Two ends initiate CREATE_CHILD_SA simultaneously; on west the crypto crosses

- west initiates CREATE_CHILD_SA to east, puts response on-hold
- east initiates CREATE_CHILD_SA to west, west puts request on-hold
- west processes CREATE_CHILD_SA response; suspends for crypto
- west processes CREATE_CHILD_SA request; suspends for crypt
