IKEv1 quick exchange where initiator restarts part way through

The responder's last transition is:

  routing: stop ESTABLISH_INBOUND, UNROUTED_BARE_NEGOTIATION->UNROUTED_INBOUND, PERMANENT; ok=yes; negotiating_ike_sa #1 established_ike_sa #1 newest_routing_sa #0->#2

The initiator then restarts initiating the partially established
connection from scratch.
