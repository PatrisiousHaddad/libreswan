two xauth+mode-config exchanges except second forgets mode-config request for lease

- client establishes connection and is assigned lease

- client sleeps

  this is mimiced by dying

- server deletes connection as DPD times out

  this is mimiced by deleting the connection

- client wakes and rekeys but forgets to ask for a new lease

  this is mimiced by re-connecting without modecfgclient=true and a
  hardwired subnet
