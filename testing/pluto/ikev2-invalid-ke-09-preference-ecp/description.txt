IKEv2 test with ike proposals where west's first proposal is still a valid
proposal for east (but not its first proposal)

east.conf:	ike=aes256-sha2;modp3072,aes256-sha2;dh19
west.conf:	ike=aes256-sha2;dh19,aes256-sha2;modp3072

The expected outcome for west initiating is to pick DH19, not MODP3072
