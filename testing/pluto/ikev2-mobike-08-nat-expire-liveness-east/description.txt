IKEv2 connection through NAT that expires; liveness=EAST

To simulate the expire, NIC changes its NAT mapping.

mobike={yes,no,nat} should no effect on this test.

EAST will send liveness requests to the expired PORT which NIC
ignores.  Eventually this will timeout causing EAST to terminate the
connection (no delete exchange).

ROAD will be left hanging.
mobike={yes,no,nat} should no effect on this test.
