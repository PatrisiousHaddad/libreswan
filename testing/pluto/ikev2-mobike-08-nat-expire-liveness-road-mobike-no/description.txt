IKEv2 connection through NAT that expires; MOBIKE=no liveness=ROAD

To simulate the expire, NIC changes its NAT mapping.

With MOBIKE=no, EAST will drop the correctly protected liveness
requests from a wrong port.  As a result, ROAD will timeout the
liveness probe and initiate a new connection.  On EAST the new
connection will have the updated PORT.
