IKEv2 connection through NAT that expires; MOBIKE=yes liveness=ROAD

To simulate the expire, NIC changes its NAT mapping.

With MOBIKE=yes, EAST seeing a correctly protected liveness request
from a wrong port will trigger MOBIKE.  MOBIKE will then update the
IKE SA and Child SA on EAST to the new port.
