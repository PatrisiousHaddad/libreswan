IKEv2 connection with MOBIKE=yes through a NAT that changes the MAP

As a result of the MAP change, the responder will receive
authenticated packets from the wrong endpoint.

In MOBIKE mode the IKE SA responder initiates a MOBIKE exchange to the
new port to authenticate that it is still talking to the same IKE SA.
Provided that exchange succeeds, both the IKE SA and the IPsec SA's
kernel state are updated.
