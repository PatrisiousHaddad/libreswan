IKEv2 active REDIRECT with two roadwarriors that connect and re-connect road,north

Road warriors, NORTH (assigned 192.0.2.101) and then ROAD (assigned
192.0.2.102) connect to EAST.  A short time later they are both
redirected to WEST with --redirect-to whack command.

ROAD, and then NORTH, proceed to connect to WEST.  Since the order
doesn't change they are assigned the same IP addresses as before.
