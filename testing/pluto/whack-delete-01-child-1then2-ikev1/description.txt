establish ISAKMP+IPsec (cuckold) then IPsec (cuckoo), delete first then second

First the first (cuckold) connection is deleted.  Since the cuckold's
ISAKMP SA is still present that is used to send out fire-and-forget
messages to delete the cuckold's IPsec and then ISAKMP SAs.

Per IKEv1 rules, the second (cuckoo) connection's IPsec SA is left
untouched.

Next the second (cuckoo) connection is deleted.  Since there is no
ISAKMP SA and delete happens immediately there's no time to establish
an ISAKMP SA to carry the delete.

Consequently EAST ends up with a lingering IPsec SA.
