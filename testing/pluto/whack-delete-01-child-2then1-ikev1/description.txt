establish ISAKMP+IPsec (cuckold) then IPsec (cuckoo), delete second then first

First the second (cuckoo) connection is deleted.  Since the cuckold's
ISAKMP SA is still present that is used to send out a fire-and-forget
/ last-gasp delete message.

Next the first (cuckold) connection is deleted.  Again, since the
cuckold's ISAKMP SA is still present, that is used to send out
fire-and-forget delete messages for the IPsec and then ISAKMP SAs.
